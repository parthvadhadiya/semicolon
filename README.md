# Semicolon: Puppeteer Starter Kit
An Web Automation and Scraping


The Puppeteer Starter Kit is a simple and lightweight web automation and scraping tool built on top of Puppeteer, a Node.js library developed by Google. With this starter kit, you can quickly and easily automate browser tasks, interact with web pages, and extract data from websites.

## Features

- **Web Automation:** Puppeteer provides a powerful API to control a headless browser, enabling you to automate various tasks, such as form filling, clicking buttons, and navigating through web pages.

- **Web Scraping:** Easily extract data from websites using Puppeteer's page manipulation capabilities. Scraping product details, news articles, or any other structured information is a breeze.

- **Headless Mode:** Puppeteer operates in headless mode by default, which means it runs without a visible browser UI. This makes it ideal for running tasks in the background or on servers.

- **Customizable:** The starter kit is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to tailor it to your specific web automation and scraping needs.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:** Start by installing the required dependencies using `npm`.

```bash
npm install
```
Run the Script: To use the Puppeteer Starter Kit, you need to create your main script file (e.g., app.js) and require the botMaster template.

```
// app.js

const botMaster = require('./botMaster');

// Your automation or scraping logic here
```
Customize the Template: The botMaster template (botMaster.js) contains various Puppeteer-based functions to assist in automation and scraping. Customize it according to your project's specific requirements.

## Usage

To begin automating tasks or scraping data, you can write your logic within the app.js file by utilizing the Puppeteer functions available in the botMaster template.

## Important Note

Please be respectful of websites' terms of service and use web scraping responsibly. Always check the website's robots.txt file for scraping permissions and avoid causing excessive traffic or disruptions.
